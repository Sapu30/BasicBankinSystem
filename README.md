# BasicBankingSystem       <h3>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqAjSncGgv8</h3>

I was supposed to create a Basic Banking System for The Sparks Foundation as an (Web Development & Designing) internship project.

So, I created a simple Dynamic website used to transfer virtual money b/w multiple users and also record the banking transactions.

<b><u>Tech Stack:</u></b> <br>
&nbsp; •	<b>Front-end</b> : HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap <br>
&nbsp; •	<b>Back-end</b> : PHP <br>
&nbsp; •	<b>Database</b> : MYSQL <br>

<b><u>Specifications in my website:</b> </u><br>
&nbsp; 1.	The project contains dummy data for upto 10 users.   <br>
&nbsp; 2.	The database contains 2 tables – User table  and Transaction history table:  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	User Table has basic fields such as name, email, account no. and amount/current balance.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Transaction History Table records all transactions happened b/w multiple users with their date & time.  <br>

<b><u>Flow of the website: </u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Home Page -> Create User -> Transfer Money -> View Transaction History  <br>

The Transfer Money page contains a table having 3 fields Sender name (account no.), Receiver name (account no.) and the amount of money sender sends to the receiver.
