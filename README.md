# BasicBankingSystem

I was supposed to create a Basic Banking System for The Sparks Foundation as an (Web Development & Designing) internship project.
So, I created a simple Dynamic website used to transfer virtual money b/w multiple users and also record the banking transactions.

Tech Stack: <br>
&nbsp •	Front-end : HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap <br>
&nbsp •	Back-end : PHP <br>
&nbsp •	Database : MYSQL <br>

Specifications in my website:
&nbsp 1.	The project contains dummy data for upto 10 users.   <br>
&nbsp 2.	The database contains 2 tables – User table  and Transaction history table:  <br>
&nbsp&nbsp •	User Table has basic fields such as name, email, account no. and amount/current balance.  <br>
&nbsp&nbsp •	Transaction History Table records all transactions happened b/w multiple users with their date & time.  <br>

Flow of the website: Home Page -> Create User -> Transfer Money -> View Transaction History  <br>
The Transfer Money page contains a table having 3 fields Sender name (account no.), Receiver name (account no.) and the amount of money sender sends to the receiver.
